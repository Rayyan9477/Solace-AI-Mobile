## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "App not running on port 8082"
```bash
# Solution: Start the app first
npx expo start --port 8082 --web
# Wait for "Logs for your project will appear below" message
```

#### "net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"
```bash
# Check if another process is using port 8082
netstat -ano | findstr ":8082"
# Kill any conflicting processes
```

#### "Global setup conflicts"
```bash
# Use standalone configuration to bypass global setup
npx playwright test --config=tests/playwright/standalone.config.js
```

#### Tests are slow or timing out
```bash
# Increase timeouts for mental health app interactions
npx playwright test --timeout=60000 --expect-timeout=20000
```

### Debugging Failed Tests
```bash
# Show trace for detailed debugging
npx playwright show-trace test-results/trace.zip

# Run single test with debug mode
npx playwright test --debug "App loads and shows onboarding screen"

# Run with verbose logging
npx playwright test --reporter=line --verbose
```
