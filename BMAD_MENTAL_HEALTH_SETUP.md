## üß† Mental Health Development Principles

### Therapeutic Design Standards
- **Color Psychology**: Calming blues, nurturing greens, peaceful grays
- **Animation Guidelines**: 60fps therapeutic transitions with gentle easing
- **Typography**: Dyslexia-friendly fonts with proper contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- **Touch Targets**: 44px minimum for accessibility compliance
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal information gradually to prevent overwhelm

### Crisis Prevention Requirements
- **Emergency Contact**: Always accessible within 2 taps/swipes
- **Crisis Hotlines**: Direct integration with 988 and crisis text lines
- **App Recovery**: Graceful handling of crashes during emotional moments
- **Offline Access**: Emergency contacts available without internet
- **Accessibility**: Crisis features work with all assistive technologies

### Accessibility Compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- **Screen Reader**: Full VoiceOver/TalkBack compatibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete app functionality via external keyboard
- **Color Independence**: Information conveyed without relying on color alone
- **Cognitive Accessibility**: Simple navigation, clear language, consistent patterns
- **Motor Accessibility**: Large touch targets, gesture alternatives

### Mental Health Data Protection
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for all therapy data at rest and in transit
- **User Control**: Complete data ownership with export/deletion capabilities
- **Privacy by Design**: Minimal data collection for therapeutic purposes only
- **HIPAA-Level**: Healthcare privacy standards for all mental health information
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: Mental health data never shared without explicit consent

## üéØ Usage Best Practices

### Always Start with Mental Health Context
Every BMAD session should begin with understanding the therapeutic purpose and mental health impact of the work being done.

### Prioritize User Safety
Crisis prevention features and user safety always take priority over other development concerns.

### Maintain Accessibility Focus
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is not optional - it's integrated into every development decision.

### Apply Trauma-Informed Design
Consider users experiencing mental health crises, anxiety, depression, and trauma in all design decisions.

### Validate Therapeutic Impact
Regularly assess how development decisions support or hinder user mental wellness and recovery.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding Therapeutically
- Ensure you're using the mental health customized agents (Dr. Winston, Dr. Sally, etc.)
- Verify the agent has loaded the therapeutic persona correctly
- Use `*help` to see mental health specific commands

### Missing Crisis Prevention Features
- Always start with `@bmad-orchestrator` and use `*crisis-plan`
- Validate emergency features with `*test-crisis-prevention`
- Ensure crisis features are tested offline and with assistive technologies

### Accessibility Issues
- Use `@ux-expert` with `*validate-therapeutic-accessibility`
- Run `@qa` with `*test-accessibility-compliance`
- Check WCAG compliance with `*audit-accessibility-compliance`
