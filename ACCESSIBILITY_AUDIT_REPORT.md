## üö® Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Emergency Button Accessibility (CRITICAL)
**File:** `src/components/dashboard/WelcomeHeader.js`

**Issue:** Emergency crisis support button failed WCAG touch target requirements
- Touch target was only 44x44px (minimum) instead of recommended 56x56px for crisis elements
- Missing emergency-specific accessibility traits
- Inadequate accessibility context for crisis situations

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// Enhanced emergency button with proper sizing and accessibility
<TouchableOpacity
  style={[styles.emergencyButton, theme.shadows.sm]}
  onPress={onEmergencyPress}
  accessible
  accessibilityRole="button"
  accessibilityLabel="Emergency Crisis Support"
  accessibilityHint="Double tap for immediate crisis support and emergency resources"
  accessibilityTraits={['button', 'startsMedia']}
  hitSlop={{ top: 8, bottom: 8, left: 8, right: 8 }}
  testID="emergency-button"
>
```

**Styles Updated:**
```javascript
emergencyGradient: {
  minWidth: 56, // MENTAL_HEALTH_ACCESSIBILITY_CONSTANTS.CRISIS_BUTTON_MIN_SIZE
  minHeight: 56,
  width: 56,
  height: 56,
  borderRadius: 28,
  justifyContent: "center",
  alignItems: "center",
}
```

### 2. Crisis Intervention Accessibility (CRITICAL)
**File:** `src/screens/MainAppScreen.js`

**Issue:** Emergency alert dialog lacked mental health context and proper announcements

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
const showEmergencyAlert = useCallback(() => {
  // Announce emergency mode activation for screen readers
  MentalHealthAccessibilityHelpers.announceWithContext(
    "Emergency support activated. Crisis resources are now available.",
    "emergency"
  );

  Alert.alert(
    "üö® Emergency Crisis Support",
    "If you are experiencing a mental health crisis, please contact:\n\n‚Ä¢ National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988\n‚Ä¢ Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741\n‚Ä¢ Or call 911 for immediate assistance\n\nYou are not alone. Help is available 24/7.",
    [
      // Enhanced buttons with accessibility announcements
      {
        text: "Call 988 Now",
        onPress: async () => {
          MentalHealthAccessibilityHelpers.announceWithContext(
            "Calling crisis support hotline",
            "emergency"
          );
          // Call implementation...
        }
      }
    ]
  );
}, []);
```

### 3. Wellness Content Accessibility (CRITICAL)
**File:** `src/screens/MainAppScreen.js`

**Issue:** Emoji-based wellness tips were inaccessible to screen readers

**Fix Applied:**

<View 
  style={styles.wellnessTipIcon}
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityRole="image"
  accessibilityLabel={`${currentTip.title} tip icon`}
  accessibilityHint="Visual icon representing the wellness tip category"
>
  <WellnessTipEmoji
